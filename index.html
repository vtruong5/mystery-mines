<h2>Mystery Mines</h2>
<ul>

<br><li><strong>High Concept:</font></strong>
Journey miles underground on an endless adventure to explore, uncover, and conquer the great mysteries that lie below. Will you find fortune or failure within the unknown?
</li>

<br><li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players can enjoy collecting treasure and exploring a large world.
</li>

<br><li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game is placed within the survival adventure genre.
</li>

<br><li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Using the arrow keys and the Z key, the player can control their character and guide them into the underground depths. There are several different types of objects such as gems that can be collected by the character. Collecting treasure will add to the character’s pockets and the player’s score. The character, controlled by the player, will encounter rocks, dirt, and other inanimate objects. Some objects are destroyed when the character touches it and some obstacles will block the characters path requiring it to be pushed aside. In addition, the character can also encounter enemies and treasure chests. 
</li>

<br><li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Games mechanics used in this prototype include: collecting objects, moving objects, collision detection, map resizing, following camera, and more.
</li>

<br><li><strong>Features:</strong>
<br>Hunger – The character’s hunger level will gradually decrease as the game proceeds and can be refilled when the player finds food. If hunger reaches zero then the game ends.
Attention Span – The attention span of the character will gradually decrease while the player does not encounter treasure. The attention span of the character can be regained if the player finds treasure. If attention span reaches zero, the character will give up and go home, thus ending the game.
Treasure Chest – Treasure chests can be found scattered around the map. The contents of the treasure chest are random and contain different effects such as decrease/increase hunger or attention span.
Enemies – Beneath the ground, it is possible to encounter entities that harm the character such as bombs and monsters. Making contact with an enemy will cause the character to drop some treasure, thus deceasing their total score.
Treasure – Collecting treasure will increase the character’s attention span. Also hidden underground, is the Ultimate Treasure. When the Ultimate Treasure is found, the character’s dream is fulfilled and the game is won and ends.
Map Piece – There are four pieces of a treasure map hidden deep underground. When all four pieces are found, the player is given a hint in where the Ultimate Treasure is hidden.
</li>

<br><li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game is set in the vast world underground. Within the world are treasure, chests, dirt, rocks, bombs, and monsters. Bombs will detonate when touched. Monsters will roam around their territory and injure anyone who gets in their way. The character, controlled by the player, is an average human with a backpack with unlimited storage. Due to the characters personality, their attention span is very limited and can easily give up.
</li>

<br><li><strong>Story:</strong>
While much of the world was interested in mysteries of space, the unnamed character, controlled by the player, was always more interested in the mysteries that lie beneath out feet. And so, this unnamed character set out to explore the world underground in hopes to satisfy their curiosity and return with fame and fortune.
</li>

<br><li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is aimed toward the casual gamer who enjoys exploration and random chance.
</li>

<br><li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Gameplay is roughly around 1~2 minutes.
</li>

<br><li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Strategically manuevering around obsticles will allow players to reach the treasure faster and protect their hunger and attention span.
</li>

<br><li><strong>Estimated Schedule:</strong>
This game may take 2-3 weeks to fully develop. Although there are many simple mechanics, together they may cause conflicts and debugging. The movements of the monsters may take a few days to develop. The most difficult aspect of the game that may take the longest to develop is the map and tileset. In addition, it may take several days to either create or gather the art and sound assets for the game and implement any animations.
</li>

<br><li><strong>Team:</strong>
During this course, I have learned the basics of Phaser from the examples on their website and have used them as aid to make simple game prototypes. Mechanics I have learned to use include, pushing objects, kill on collision, spritesheets and sprite animation, random numbers, basic character movement, buttons, mouse click and time based events. In addition, I also have basic art skills to either make game art assets or edit assets found from the internet. Knowledge and skills that I lack for this game would be on how to make a larger map, tilemap, enemy movement maps, game stages and overall better knowledge of making a game in Phaser.
</li>

<br><li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Assets used in this prototype include tilesets and characters from RPGMaker and self created art assets.
</li>

<br><li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Phaser Examples: Sprite Vs Group Example, Rat Attack. <br>
Other games: Neopets Snowmuncher, Pocket Mine (and other mobile mining games)
